# Reptile Tracker

This is an Android/IOS application I developed utilizing Flutter and the Firebase Database. This app is designed as a simple way to keep a journal of reptiles or really any animal that your come across. This idea came to me after I could not remember the type of snake I had captured at a young age. This is in no way a production app, and only is only in a test state. I do not intend to expand it further.
